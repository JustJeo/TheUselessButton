# The Useless Button
This is The Useless Button. It has absolutely no purpose aside from being pushed.

## Inspiration
This project was created with inspiration from "The World's Most Useless Box". Although this is not a physical button like there is a physical box, I wanted to have my fun with a snarky little button.

## Reason of Creation
There is no real reason for why I created this little personal project. I just found it as something to do to practice my coding skills. I'm currently job hunting and wanted to make sure that I wouldn't get rusty with what I learned from General Assembly. I had a lot of fun making a tiny game for my Software Engineering program and wanted to make another tiny project while I was on the search for a job.

## About the Developer
I am a junior Software Engineer with strong Front End Developer skills. I love to recreate prototypes and duplicating them on a live website. I enjoy making websites look "pretty" and pleasing to the eye. Although I graduated from my program as someone with fullstack abilities, I know my backend development could do some work. Still, it doesn't stop me from mirroring wireframes created on Figma by UX Designers. With some time and belief in me, I know I can bring a website to life.
